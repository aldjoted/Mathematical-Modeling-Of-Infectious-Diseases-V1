# Hill Climbing Optimizer Settings
# Note: For boolean flags, use 1.0 for true and 0.0 for false.

# iterations: Total number of optimization iterations.
# Default: 5000
iterations 10

# initial_step: Initial coefficient for the step size.
# Default: 1.0
initial_step 0.1

# cooling_rate: Rate at which the step size coefficient is reduced (multiplied by this factor).
# Should be between 0.001 and 0.999.
# Default: 0.995
cooling_rate 0.995

# refinement_steps: Number of binary refinement steps to apply to a promising move.
# Default: 5
refinement_steps 5

# burnin_factor: Fraction of total iterations to consider as the burn-in phase.
# During burn-in, step sizes might be handled differently (e.g., larger).
# Value between 0.0 and 1.0.
# Default: 0.2
burnin_factor 0.01

# burnin_step_increase: Multiplier for step size during the burn-in phase.
# Can help explore the space more broadly initially.
# Default: 1.5
burnin_step_increase 0.05

# post_burnin_step_coef: Base step size coefficient used after the burn-in phase for 'all parameter' steps.
# Default: 1.0
post_burnin_step_coef 0.05

# one_param_step_coef: Base step size coefficient for 'one parameter at a time' steps.
# Default: 1.0
one_param_step_coef 0.05

# min_step_coef: Minimum allowed step size coefficient to prevent steps from becoming too small.
# Default: 0.01
min_step_coef 0.00001

# report_interval: Frequency (in iterations) for logging progress updates.
# Default: 100 
report_interval 50

# restart_interval: Iteration interval for performing a restart from the best-found solution.
# 0 means no restarts.
# Default: 0 
restart_interval 1000

# restart_resets_step: If true (1.0), reset the step size coefficient to its initial value upon restart.
# Default: 1.0 (true)
restart_resets_step 1.0

# enable_bidirectional: If true (1.0), check both forward and reverse directions for a step.
# Default: 1.0 (true)
enable_bidirectional 1.0

# enable_elongation: If true (1.0), attempt to extend a successful step further in the same direction.
# Default: 1.0 (true)
enable_elongation 1.0
