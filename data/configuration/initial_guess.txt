# SEPAIHRD Model Parameters INITIAL GUESS for Spain (Mar-Dec 2020)
#
# Justification: The following parameters have been updated based on public data and literature
# from the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. The goal is to provide a scientifically
# sound starting point for a more detailed calibration.
# Simulation Start Date: March 1, 2020. Time 't' is in days from this date.

# --- NPI and Beta Intervention Schedules ---
# Justification: The end times correspond to major shifts in national policy in Spain.
# - Day 13 (March 14, 2020): Start of the first national "estado de alarma" (state of alarm) with a strict lockdown. [9, 16]
# - Day 63 (May 2, 2020): Beginning of the phased de-escalation, allowing people outdoors for exercise. [16]
# - Day 84 (May 23, 2020): Further easing of restrictions as part of the de-escalation plan.
# - Day 111 (June 19, 2020): End of the first state of alarm and transition to the "new normality". [12, 20]
# - Day 183 (Sept 1, 2020): Post-summer period with regional measures in place to control outbreaks.
# - Day 237 (Oct 25, 2020): Declaration of the second national state of alarm in response to the second wave. [12]
# - Day 305 (Dec 31, 2020): End of the simulation period.

# --- Time-varying Beta parameters (Transmission Rate) ---
# Justification: Beta is notoriously difficult to estimate a priori and is a key target for calibration.
# These values are rough estimates based on R0 values and expected impact of NPIs.
# beta_1: Corresponds to an R0 of ~3.0-3.5 before lockdown, consistent with early estimates for Spain which were high, some even suggesting R0 > 5. [4, 7]
# beta_2 to beta_7: These are placeholders showing a drop during lockdown and subsequent fluctuations.
# The calibration algorithm is expected to heavily refine these.

beta_2 1.5e-01
beta_3 2.5e-01

beta_5 4.0e-01
beta_6 3.0e-01
beta_7 3.5e-01

# --- NPI scaling factors (kappa_values for contact reduction) ---
# Justification: Kappa represents the reduction in social contacts due to NPIs.
# kappa_1 (t < 13): 1.0 (baseline, no interventions).
# kappa_2 (t=13-63): 0.35 (strong reduction, ~65% decrease in contacts during the strict national lockdown).
# kappa_3 (t=63-84): 0.50 (partial relaxation during early de-escalation).
# kappa_4 (t=84-111): 0.65 (further relaxation during later de-escalation).
# kappa_5 (t=111-183): 0.75 (summer period, "new normality" with masks and distancing but higher mobility).
# kappa_6 (t=183-237): 0.70 (post-summer, some regional restrictions reinstated).
# kappa_7 (t=237-305): 0.60 (second state of alarm, less strict than the first but with curfews and significant restrictions).

kappa_2 0.35

# --- Other Disease Transmission Parameters ---
beta      6.2e-01   # Fallback value, same as beta_1
# Justification: Represents reduced transmissibility of symptomatic individuals due to isolation/illness.
# Set to 0.7, a common assumption in epidemiological models.
theta     7.0e-01

# --- Disease Progression Rates (inverse of durations in days) ---
# Justification: Rates are the inverse of the mean duration for each period.
# sigma: Inverse of mean incubation period. Estimated at ~5-6 days for early variants. [41] 1/5.5 = 0.18.
# gamma_p: Inverse of pre-symptomatic infectious period. Estimated to be around 2-3 days. 1/2.5 = 0.4.
# gamma_A, gamma_I: Inverse of infectious period for asymptomatic/symptomatic. Assumed to be around 7-10 days. 1/8.5 = 0.118.
# gamma_H: Inverse of hospital stay. Median stay in Spain in 2020 was ~11 days. [1] 1/11 = 0.091.
# gamma_ICU: Inverse of ICU stay. Median stay in Spain was longer than in other countries, around 15-23 days. [5, 18] Using a midpoint of 19 days. 1/19 = 0.053.

gamma_ICU 5.3e-02

# --- Age-specific Parameters (4 age groups: 0-30, 30-60, 60-80, 80+) ---
# Justification (Susceptibility 'a'): Based on studies suggesting children and young adults had lower
# susceptibility to the original SARS-CoV-2 strain compared to older adults. [21, 24, 26]
# Values are relative to the 60-80 group.
a         0.50 0.80 1.00 0.90
# Justification (Infectiousness 'h_infec'): Some studies suggest younger people (<60) may be more infectious. [15]
# However, other studies show no significant difference. [27] We start with a neutral assumption of near-equal infectiousness,
# allowing calibration to adjust it.
h_infec   1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0
# Justification (Fraction asymptomatic 'p'): Highly variable. Seroprevalence studies suggested a large number of
# undetected, likely asymptomatic or mild, cases. [11] Asymptomatic rates are known to be higher in younger people.
# These are literature-informed estimates.
p         0.60 0.40 0.20 0.10
# Justification (Hospitalization rate 'h'): Based on Spanish surveillance data which showed a strong age-gradient. [10, 44]
# These values are fractions of symptomatic individuals who get hospitalized.
h         8.0e-03 6.0e-02 2.8e-01 4.5e-01
# Justification (ICU admission rate 'icu'): Rate among those hospitalized. Also strongly age-dependent.
# Data from Spain indicates about 10.9% of hospitalized patients went to ICU in 2020. [1, 3]
# The rate often decreases in the oldest group due to clinical decisions against ICU admission.
icu       5.0e-03 3.0e-02 5.0e-02 2.0e-02
# Justification (Hospital mortality 'd_H' and ICU mortality 'd_ICU'):
# Mortality rates among non-ICU and ICU patients, respectively. Overall in-hospital mortality in Spain was high in 2020 (~16%). [1, 3]
# Rates increase dramatically with age. [13, 37, 42]
d_H       2.0e-03 9.0e-03 5.0e-02 3.5e-01
d_ICU     1.8e-03 1.5e-02 2.5e-02 5.0e-01

# --- Initial State Multipliers ---
# Justification: These parameters estimate the initial number of individuals in each compartment (E, P, A, etc.)
# at the start of the simulation. They are highly sensitive and best determined by a calibration algorithm.
# The values from the generic file are retained as a reasonable starting point for the optimization process.
