# Metropolis-Hastings Sampler Settings
# Note: For boolean flags, use 1.0 for true and 0.0 for false.

# burn_in: Number of initial MCMC iterations to discard (burn-in period).
# Helps the chain converge to the stationary distribution.
# Default: 5000
burn_in 0

# mcmc_iterations: Number of MCMC iterations to run after the burn-in period.
# These iterations are used for sampling from the posterior distribution.
# Default: 10000
mcmc_iterations 10

# thinning: Interval for collecting samples. E.g., if 10, every 10th sample post-burn-in is kept.
# Reduces autocorrelation between samples.
# Default: 10
thinning 1

# mcmc_step_size: Coefficient for the proposal distribution's standard deviation.
# Affects the size of steps taken in the parameter space. Needs tuning.
# Default: 0.1
mcmc_step_size 1.0

# calculate_posterior_mean: Whether to calculate and potentially use the posterior mean
# of the collected samples as the final best parameter set (if it yields a better objective value).
# Default: 1.0 (true)
calculate_posterior_mean 1.0 

# report_interval: Frequency (in iterations) for logging progress updates.
# Default: 200
report_interval 10

# mcmc_enable_refinement: Whether to enable an additional refinement step for proposed parameters.
# This can involve a local search or directional exploration to improve proposal quality.
# Default: 0.0 (false)
mcmc_enable_refinement 1.0

# mcmc_refinement_steps: If refinement is enabled, this specifies the number of
# binary refinement steps to perform.
# Default: 0
mcmc_refinement_steps 5
