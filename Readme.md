# Mathematical Modeling of SARS-CoV-2 Dynamics in Spain and General SEIR Framework

This C++ project implements and calibrates an age-structured deterministic compartmental model (SEPAIHRD) to simulate the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic dynamics in Spain during 2020. It also includes a C++ framework with implementations of fundamental SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) models. The project focuses on Bayesian calibration techniques, assessment of Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention (NPI) impacts, and estimation of hidden epidemic dynamics, applying methodologies discussed in the SMATM128 course (UNamur).

## Usage

### Running Simulations

Executables are built into the `build/bin/` directory.

*   **SEPAIHRD Age-Structured Model:**
    The main executable for the SEPAIHRD model is `sepaihrd_age_structured_main`.
    ```bash
    cd build/bin
    ./sepaihrd_age_structured_main [options]
    ```
    Available options (see `src/model/main.cpp` for details):
    *   `--algorithm <name>` or `-a <name>`: Choose calibration algorithm.
        *   `pso` or `psomcmc`: Particle Swarm Optimization followed by MCMC (default).
        *   `hill` or `hillmcmc`: Hill Climbing followed by MCMC.
    *   `--help` or `-h`: Show help message.

*   **Age-Structured SIR Model:**
    Run the main simulation:
    ```bash
    cd build/bin
    ./sir_age_structured_main
    ```
    Run the calibration demo:
    ```bash
    cd build/bin
    ./sir_age_structured_calibration_demo
    ```

*   **Base SIR Models:**
    Executables for basic SIR models are also available:
    ```bash
    cd build/bin
    ./sir_model
    ./sir_pop_var
    ./sir_stochastic
    ```
    These typically run predefined scenarios or use parameters from configuration files or hardcoded values.

### Input Data

The models and calibration routines rely on various input files, primarily located in the `data/` directory:

*   **Contact Matrices:** (e.g., `data/contacts.csv`)
    *   CSV file representing the contact rates between different age groups.
    *   Dimensions: `num_age_classes` x `num_age_classes`.
*   **Epidemiological Data:** (e.g., `data/processed/processed_data.csv`)
    *   CSV file containing time series of observed data for calibration (e.g., daily new hospitalizations, ICU admissions, deaths, reported cases).
    *   Typically includes a 'date' column and data columns for different metrics, often stratified by age group.
    *   Used by `CalibrationData` class.
*   **Model & Calibration Configuration Files:** (located in `data/configuration/`)
    *   `initial_guess.txt`: Initial values for parameters to be calibrated. Format: one parameter per line with its value, or specific format for `FileUtils::readSEPAIHRDParameters`.
    *   `param_bounds.txt`: Lower and upper bounds for parameters during calibration. Format: `parameter_name lower_bound upper_bound` per line.
    *   `proposal_sigmas.txt`: Proposal standard deviations for MCMC sampling. Format: `parameter_name sigma_value` per line.
    *   `params_to_calibrate.txt`: A list of parameter names that the calibration algorithm should optimize. Format: one parameter name per line.
    *   `pso_settings.txt`, `mcmc_settings.txt`, `hill_climbing_settings.txt`: Key-value pairs for algorithm-specific settings (e.g., `num_particles value`, `num_iterations value`).
    *   General parameter files (e.g., for SEPAIHRD model): Text files with parameter names and their values (scalar or age-specific vectors). Lines starting with `#` are comments. See `FileUtils::readSEPAIHRDParameters` for parsing logic.

### Output Data

*   **Simulation Results:**
    *   Saved as CSV files in `data/output/` (e.g., `sepaihrd_age_baseline_results.csv`, `sepaihrd_age_final_calibrated_run.csv`, `sir_age_baseline_results.csv`).
    *   Typically include columns for time and the state of each compartment (S, E, P, A, I, H, R, D) for each age group.
*   **Calibration Outputs:**
    *   Stored in `data/calibration_output/`.
    *   `mcmc_summary.csv`: Contains summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, quantiles) for the posterior distributions of calibrated parameters and derived metrics.
    *   Other files might include MCMC trace plots (if generated by scripts), posterior predictive check data, etc.
*   **Log Files:**
    *   Application logs are printed to the console.
    *   File logging can be enabled via the [`Logger`](include/utils/Logger.hpp) class, typically to a file like `epidemic_model.log` in the execution directory.

## Configuration

Simulations and calibrations are configured through:

1.  **Command-line arguments:** As seen with `sepaihrd_age_structured_main` for selecting calibration algorithms.
2.  **Configuration Files:** Primarily text files located in `data/configuration/`. These files define:
    *   Model parameters (e.g., transmission rates, recovery rates, NPI effectiveness).
    *   Initial conditions for the model compartments.
    *   Parameters for calibration algorithms (e.g., number of MCMC iterations, PSO particle count).
    *   Which parameters to calibrate and their bounds.
    *   NPI strategy parameters (e.g., start/end dates of interventions, strength of interventions).
3.  **Source Code:** Some scenarios or default parameters might be hardcoded, especially for simpler models or demo applications.

Refer to the `main.cpp` files in `src/model/`, `src/sir_age_structured/`, and `src/base/main/` for specific configuration loading mechanisms. Utility functions in `src/utils/ReadCalibrationConfiguration.cpp` and `src/utils/FileUtils.cpp` handle parsing of many configuration files.

## Running Tests

The project uses Google Test for unit testing.

1.  Ensure the project is built (see [Installation](#installation)).
2.  From the `build` directory, run:
    ```bash
    make test
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    ctest
    ```
    This will execute all defined tests. Test executables (e.g., `utils_tests`, `model_tests`, `sir_age_structured_tests`) are also created in `build/bin/` (or a test-specific subdirectory within `build/`) and can be run individually.

## Memory Checking

Memory leak detection is integrated using Valgrind.

1.  Ensure the project is built.
2.  From the `build` directory, run `make memcheck_<executable_name>`. For example:
    ```bash
    make memcheck_sepaihrd_age_structured_main
    ```
    This will run the specified executable (e.g., `sepaihrd_age_structured_main`) under Valgrind with options to check for memory leaks. Other executables with memcheck targets include `sir_model`, `sir_pop_var`, `sir_stochastic`, `sir_age_structured_main`, and `sir_age_structured_calibration_demo`.

## Scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains utility scripts for various tasks. For detailed information, refer to `scripts/Readme.md`.

*   **`scripts/age-structured-calibration/`**: Scripts for calibrating age-structured models, potentially involving MCMC analysis or parameter fitting routines.
*   **`scripts/data-processing/`**: Scripts for cleaning raw data, transforming data formats, and other pre-processing steps necessary for model input.
*   **`scripts/data-visualization/`**: Scripts to generate plots, charts, or other graphical representations of data, model outputs, and calibration results.
*   **`scripts/utils/`**: Utility scripts providing helper functions or common functionalities used by other scripts in the project.
